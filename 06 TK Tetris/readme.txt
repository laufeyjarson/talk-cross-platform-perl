This demonstration shows that it is possible to run a GUI across multiple
platforms.

The tetris.pl script used is unchanged from the O'Reilly book,
"Advanced Perl Programming" by Sriram Srinivasan.  All that was needed was
to install the Tk module from CPAN.  See the book for a lot more information.

Since the sample files belongs to O'Reilly, it isn't included here.

It can be downloaded from their web site at:

ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/published/oreilly/nutshell/advanced_perl/examples.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/published/oreilly/nutshell/advanced_perl/examples.zip

The demo should run on any Perl with the Tk module installed.
