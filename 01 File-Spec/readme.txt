This demonstration shows the basic functions of the core Perl File::Spec
module.  Just run the perl script on any platform and look at what it produces.

Included are sample runs from four platforms:

output-osx.txt        - Output of the script from Mac OSX Mavericks
output-win-as.txt     - Output of the script from Windows, Active State Perl
output-win-cygwin.txt - Output of the script from Windows, cygwin Perl
output-linux.txt      - Output of the script from Linux.

The script should run on virtually any Perl installation.
