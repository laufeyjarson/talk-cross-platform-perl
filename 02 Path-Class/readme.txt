This demonstration shows the basic functions of the Path::Class object.
To run the script, the Path::Class module will need to be installed from CPAN.
It is a pure Perl module and should install easily on almost every platform.

Included are sample runs from four platforms:

output-osx.txt        - Output of the script from Mac OSX Mavericks
output-win-as.txt     - Output of the script from Windows, Active State Perl
output-win-cygwin.txt - Output of the script from Windows, cygwin Perl
output-linux.txt      - Output of the script from Linux.

The script should run on any Perl with Path::Class installed.
